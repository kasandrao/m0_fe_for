# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Not as confident as I would like. I know tomorrow, it will feel easier
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had unproductive struggle a lot of the time. I was googling things and getting overwhelmed by the results. Talking about iot wewith Sara and Patrick helped a ton though, which I think is part of the process.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I will have to review the whole lesson again as I'm not feel;ing solidly confident in it. I'll have to make time in the evenings after I'm done with other work.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I would benefit from some more help on finding helpful google answers.
